# Animal_Shelters_PostgreSQL_Project

## üìñ Description
A small project that manages different shelters along with their staff, animals, animals_types and adopters. The project focuses on practising functions and procedures in PostgreSQL.

## üõ†Ô∏è What You Can Do
- See a table of animals based on the characteristics you choose
- Receive information about the person from the staff that takes care of the animal you chose to adopt
- Receive information about the shelter in which the animal you chose is located
- Adopt animal - you need to provide information about yourself and give the shelter and animal's names
- Apply for being a member of the staff in a chosen from you shelter (firstly, you receive the names of all the available shelters and then you apply for being a part of the staff in this shelter)

*Inserting data into the tables was done using `Mockaroo`. Only a few things were changed and added by me.

*There are examples and instructions on how to use the functions and procedures.
